      <p class="lead">Usually adding audio to a text story is an uncomfortable choice. Either the user reads or listens but never both. Until now.</p>
      <p>SoundCite is a simple-to-use tool that helps content creators add audio to their stories. The audio is not isolated in a player positioned off to the side, interrupting the text or housed in a garish player that distracts content consumers from reading.</p>
      <p>SoundCite's audio is just a link that plays right under the relevant text.</p>
      <p>SoundCite audio adds emotion or context to the text. It never asks users to look away from what their reading. And, most importantly, it requires no technical skills to use.</p>
      <p>SoundCite is currently in an alpha, pre-release stage. Check out our <a href="http://github.com/NUKnightLab/soundcite">GitHub repo</a> and please feel free to contribute! We will have more news on a beta release soon.</p>

      <div class="question span3">
        <h3>Do I need to know &lt;code&gt; to use SoundCite?</h3>
        <p class="answer">Absolutely not. SoundCite is friction-free for media consumers and creators. If you can record audio, upload it to <a href="http://soundcloud.com" target="_blank">soundcloud.com</a>, click a few buttons and can cut & paste you are ready to embed your own audio. You won't have to write or read HTML, CSS or JavaScript to use SoundCite.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="question span3">
        <h3>Can I customize what SoundCite looks like?</h3>
        <p class="answer">SoundCite is designed to work with virtually any site or theme design. The simple shading of the links should compliment your design without any customization. But we know you may still want to change the size, color or shading so... we're working on it. Stay tuned. More customization will follow.</p>

      <div class="question span3">
        <h3>Can I use an audio source other than SoundCloud?</h3>
        <p class="answer">SoundCloud is a great platform but we know you might want to use audio you host on a variety of other sources or your own servers. We're working on this too. Hopefully we can start expanding the potential sources soon.</p>
