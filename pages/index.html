  <h2>How it Works</h2>
  <p>Audio is powerful device that can add emotion or context to a story. Unfortunately audio clips force uncomfortable choices: either read or listen, but not both. Until now. SoundCite is simple-to-use tool that lets you add inline audio to your story. The audio is not isolated, it plays right under the text <span class="soundcite" data-id="55521179" data-start="5992" data-end="6651">you choose</span>.</p>
  <p>SoundCite is currently in an <a href="http://github.com/NUKnightLab/soundcite">alpha, pre-release stage</a>.</p>

          SoundCite is designed to work with virtually any site or theme design. But if you want to change the size, color or shading you'll be able to modify the stylesheets to do so ... soon.
