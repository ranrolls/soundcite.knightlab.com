Hello, and welcome to SoundCite. SoundCite is a tool for making inline audio easy and seamless. In this video, I will show you just how easy creating your first SoundCite clip is.

Today we are going to work with this example of a track review of Tame Impala's Elephant from Pitchfork. The review makes a reference to thick, one-note guitar riffs that could definitely use a clip of that awesome riff. So we're going to make that clip.

On the SoundCite homepage, you will find the clip creator. It is an easy, three-step process. First, we will find the sound we want to clip on SoundCloud. Here it is. I will copy the URL and paste it in the URL box back at SoundCite.

Now that we have our sound, we need to set our start and end points. I know that the guitar riff I want is at the beginning of the song, so I'm going to leave our start time alone.

To find where I want the clip to end, I will play the sound, wait for the end of the riff, pause the sound and click the set end time button. Watch this.

Finally, I need to tell SoundCite what text to link the clip I just made to. From our Pitchfork example, we want the phrase â€œthick, one-note guitar riffs. So lets copy that and paste it into the link text box on the SoundCite creator.

Now lets create our clip. We can test it to make sure our time codes are exactly as we want them to be. If we are unhappy, we can delete the clip, make adjustments, and create a new one. You can also create as many clips as you want for each sound.

Now let's embed our clip. For every post on your website that uses SoundCite, you will need our header embed code. You only need it once per page. Then, for each clip, take the embed code for that clip and paste it where it belongs in your post.

That's it! I hope you can find many uses for SoundCite! Thank you for watching!
